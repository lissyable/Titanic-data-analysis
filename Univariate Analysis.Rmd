Read the titanic dataset which divided into train.csv and test.csv from the following website.

```{r}
train_data <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agconti/kaggle-titanic/master/data/train.csv",header=T,sep=",")
test_data <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agconti/kaggle-titanic/master/data/test.csv",header=T,sep=",")
```


Have a look at the data set.
```{r}
str(train_data)
```
Here we have 891 observations and 12 variables in the training data set. 
1.Survived (whether the passenger died or survived)
If Survived is 0 means passenger died and 1 means passenger Survived. This is the dependent variable.Let us check this variable first.We are converting this variable into factor.
```{r}
train_data$Survived = as.factor(train_data$Survived)
```
Check the missing values for Survived
```{r}
sum(is.na(train_data$Survived) == TRUE)
```
There are no missing values for Survived

Table of Passengers survived vs passengers not survived 
```{r}
table(train_data$Survived)
```
Out of 891 passengers, 549 were died and 342 were survived

Proportion of Passengers survived vs passengers not survived 
```{r}
prop.table(table(train_data$Survived))
```
So 62% of passengers died and 38% survived.

Data visualization of Survived
```{r}
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(train_data, aes(x = Survived, fill = Survived)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100), position='dodge') +
  geom_text(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100 + 0.5, 
                  label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..) * 100, 2), '%')), 
              stat = 'count', 
              position = position_dodge(.9), 
              size = 3) + 
    labs(x = 'Survived', y = 'percent', fill = 'Survived', title = 'Survived')
```

Next we combine both train and test data.
```{r}
str(test_data)
test_data$Survived <- NA
Full_data <- rbind(train_data, test_data)
```
Test data has 418 observations
Check the Full data
```{r}
str(Full_data)
```
The Full data has 1309 observations and 12 variables.

Look at the first few rows
```{r}
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
glimpse(Full_data)
```
Let us have the summary of the data
```{r}
summary(Full_data)
```
2.Pclass (passengers socio-economic status (SES) class 1=Upper 2=Middle 3=Lower)
First we convert this variable into factor.
```{r}
Full_data$Pclass = as.factor(Full_data$Pclass)
```
Check there is NA's in the attributes.
```{r}
colSums(is.na(Full_data))
```
There is no NA's in Pclass.
Let us check for blank spaces
```{r}
colSums(Full_data =="")
```
There is no blank spaces
Table of passengers in 3 classes
```{r}
table(Full_data$Pclass)
```
Proportion of passengers in 3 classes
```{r}
prop.table(table(Full_data$Pclass))
```
From this we can see that most of the passengers were in the lower level(Pclass=3), more than 50%

Data visualization of Pclass
```{r}
ggplot(Full_data, aes(x = Pclass, fill = Pclass)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100), position='dodge') +
  geom_text(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100 + 0.5, 
                  label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..) * 100, 2), '%')), 
              stat = 'count', 
              position = position_dodge(.9), 
              size = 3) + 
    labs(x = 'Pclass', y = 'percent', fill = 'Pclass', title = 'Pclass')
```
3. Name (passengers name)
Change this variable into character.
```{r}
Full_data$Name = as.character(Full_data$Name)
```
Check for the missing values
```{r}
colSums(is.na(Full_data))
colSums(Full_data =="")
```
There are no missing values for Name.
The Name variable contains a Title for each person, So if we separate this from the name we will get a tidy data and we can analyse more accurate.So Make a variable named Title from Name.

```{r}
Full_data$Title <- sapply(Full_data$Name, FUN=function(x) {strsplit(x, split='[,.]')[[1]][2]})
Full_data$Title <- sub(' ', '', Full_data$Title)
```
Have a look at the Title table
```{r}
table(Full_data$Title)
```
It is better to reduce the number of titles to create a better and more substantial Titles that can be used for prediction. Ms. is usually used for younger married women. I join this one with Miss. Mlle stands for Mademoiselle in French so join this category with Miss and also Dona and Lady i put it with Miss. I assume that Mme stands for Madame, and I will join Madame with Mrs. I put Lady is also with Mrs. For the titles Captis Captain, col is colonel, Major, Sir, the Countess, Don, Dr, Jonkheer, Rev, I will create one new category Officer.
```{r}
Full_data$Title[Full_data$Title %in% c('Mlle', 'Ms', 'Dona', 'Lady')] <- 'Miss'
Full_data$Title[Full_data$Title %in% c('Mme')] <- 'Mrs'
Full_data$Title[Full_data$Title %in% c('Capt', 'Col', 'Don', 'Dr', 'Jonkheer', 'Rev', 'the Countess', 'Major', 'Sir')] <- 'Officer'
```
Now visualize the new Title variable 
```{r}
ggplot(Full_data, aes(x = Title, fill = Title)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100), position='dodge') +
  geom_text(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100 + 0.5, 
                  label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..) * 100, 2),'%')), 
              stat = 'count', 
              position = position_dodge(.9), 
              size = 3) + 
    labs(x = 'Title', y = 'percent', fill = 'Title', title = 'Title')
```
4.Sex (Female or Male)
There are no missing values in Sex. Have a look at the Sex table.
```{r}
table(Full_data$Sex)
```
Check the proportion of male and female
```{r}
prop.table(table(Full_data$Sex))
```
So 64% male and 36% of female were travelled.
Now visualize it
```{r}
ggplot(Full_data, aes(x = Sex, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100), position='dodge') +
  geom_text(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100 + 0.5, 
                  label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..) * 100, 2), '%')), 
              stat = 'count', 
              position = position_dodge(.9), 
              size = 3) + 
    labs(x = 'Sex', y = 'percent', fill = 'Sex', title = 'Sex')
```
5.Age ( Passenger's Age)
Check for the missing values
```{r}
sum(is.na(Full_data$Age) == TRUE)
```
For an age variable containing a missing value, assign the mean age value for each title not containing a missing value.So first compute the mean age for Mr,Mrs,Miss,Master and Officer and assign this mean to age value that corresponds to.
First find the mean of all Name whose Title is Mr.
```{r}
mean_mr = mean(Full_data$Age[Full_data$Title == 'Mr' & !is.na(Full_data$Age)])
Full_data$Age[Full_data$Title == 'Mr' & is.na(Full_data$Age)]=mean_mr
```
Now same procedure with Mrs
```{r}
mean_mrs = mean(Full_data$Age[Full_data$Title == 'Mrs' & !is.na(Full_data$Age)])
Full_data$Age[Full_data$Title == 'Mrs' & is.na(Full_data$Age)]=mean_mrs
```
Now with Master
```{r}
mean_master = mean(Full_data$Age[Full_data$Title == 'Master' & !is.na(Full_data$Age)])
Full_data$Age[Full_data$Title == 'Master' & is.na(Full_data$Age)]=mean_master
```
Now with Miss
```{r}
mean_miss = mean(Full_data$Age[Full_data$Title == 'Miss' & !is.na(Full_data$Age)])
Full_data$Age[Full_data$Title == 'Miss' & is.na(Full_data$Age)]=mean_miss
```
Now with Officer
```{r}
mean_officer = mean(Full_data$Age[Full_data$Title == 'Officer' & !is.na(Full_data$Age)])
Full_data$Age[Full_data$Title == 'Officer' & is.na(Full_data$Age)]=mean_officer
```
Have a look at the summary of Age
```{r}
summary(Full_data$Age)
```
Now visualize the data
```{r}
ggplot(Full_data, aes(x=Age)) +labs(title="Age") +
  geom_density(aes(fill = Age), alpha = 0.5)
```
Here we can see the mean age of passengers were 29.90 and most people who travelled were betwee 30 and 35.Highest Age is 80.

6. SibSp (Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic)
Check there is missing values
```{r}
colSums(is.na(Full_data))
```
There are no missing values. 
See the table of SibSp
```{r}
table(Full_data$SibSp)
```
See the proportion
```{r}
prop.table(table(Full_data$SibSp))
```
Here we can see that 68% without siblings or spouses.

Visualize this data
```{r}
ggplot(Full_data, aes(x = SibSp, fill = SibSp)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100), position='dodge') +
  geom_text(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100 + 0.5, 
                  label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..) * 100, 2),'%')),
              stat = 'count', 
              position = position_dodge(.9), 
              size = 3) +
    labs(x = 'SibSp', y = 'percent', fill = 'SibSp', title = 'Parch')
```
7.Parch (Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic)
Check for the missing values
```{r}
colSums(is.na(Full_data))
```
There are no missing values
Check the table for Parch
```{r}
table(Full_data$Parch)
```
Check with proportion
```{r}
prop.table(table(Full_data$Parch))
```
77% passengers were without parents or children
Now visualize this data
```{r}
ggplot(Full_data, aes(x = Parch, fill = Parch)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100), position='dodge') +
  geom_text(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100 + 0.5, 
                  label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..) * 100, 2),'%')),
              stat = 'count', 
              position = position_dodge(.9), 
              size = 3) +
    labs(x = 'Parch', y = 'percent', fill = 'Parch', title = 'Parch')
```
8.Ticket(Passenger's ticket number)
First we change it to character
```{r}
Full_data$Ticket <- as.character(Full_data$Ticket)
```
Check with missing data
```{r}
colSums(is.na(Full_data))
colSums(Full_data =="")
```
There are no missing values.
```{r}
actual_mode <- table(Full_data$Ticket)
names(actual_mode)[actual_mode == max(actual_mode)]
```
The ticket number CA.2343 is the most occured one 11 times.

9. Fare(Passenger fare)
Check the missing values
```{r}
colSums(is.na(Full_data))
```
One missing value for the fare.

Let's check the summaryof fare
```{r}
summary(Full_data$Fare)
```
Maximun fare is 512.329 and mean of fare is 33.295
Let us find the details of fare with NA
```{r}
#install.packages("kableExtra")
library(kableExtra)
kable(Full_data[which(is.na(Full_data$Fare)),c('Title', 'Survived', 'Pclass', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Ticket', 'Fare',  'Embarked')])
```
From this we can understand that the missing fare is a passenger who embarked to Southampton and ttravelled in class 3 by alone.
So i took the mean fare of such class.
```{r}

Full_data$Fare[is.na(Full_data$Fare)] = mean(Full_data$Fare[which(Full_data$Embarked == 'S' & Full_data$Pclass == '3' & Full_data$SibSp == 0 & Full_data$Parch == 0)], na.rm = TRUE)
```
Now visualize the Fare variable.
```{r}
ggplot(Full_data, aes(x=Fare)) + labs(title = "Fare") +
  geom_density(aes(fill = Fare), alpha = 0.5)
```

10.Cabin (Passenger's cabin number)
Check the missing values
```{r}
colSums(Full_data =="")
```
Since there are too much information is missing, i am ignoring this variable.
11. Embarked (Port of Embarkation, C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Check the missing values first
```{r}
colSums(Full_data =="")
```
There are 2 missing values
Check the table
```{r}
table(Full_data$Embarked)
```
Most passengers embarked at Southampton.
Let's check that 2 rows who missed the embarked
```{r}
kable(Full_data[which(Full_data$Embarked ==''),c('Title', 'Survived', 'Pclass', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Ticket', 'Fare',  'Embarked')])
```
From this data, we can understand that the missing Embarked passengers are females travelled alone in class 1. 
Have a look at the rows which has the same characters.
```{r}
table(Full_data[which(Full_data$Pclass == '1' & Full_data$SibSp == 0 & Full_data$Parch == 0, Full_data$Sex == 'female'), c('Embarked')])
```
Here most people in this category embarked at Southampton, so i put S to the missing place.
```{r}
Full_data$Embarked[Full_data$Embarked == ""] = 'S'
```
Now look at the proportion 
```{r}
prop.table(table(Full_data$Embarked))
```
So most people embarked to Southampton, which is 70%.
Let us visualize it
```{r}
ggplot(Full_data, aes(x = Embarked, fill = Embarked)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100), position='dodge') +
  geom_text(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100 + 0.5, 
                  label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..) * 100, 2),'%')),
              stat = 'count', 
              position = position_dodge(.9), 
              size = 3) +
    labs(x = 'Embarked', y = 'percent', fill = 'Embarked', title = 'Embarked')
```
Next if we add SibSp and Parch, we will get more information about family.
So we are going to make another column named FamilySize.
```{r}
Full_data$FamilySize <- Full_data$SibSp + Full_data$Parch +1
```
Have a look at this table
```{r}
table(Full_data$FamilySize)
```
Let us look at the proportion
```{r}
prop.table(table(Full_data$FamilySize))
```
So 60% passengers were travelled alone.
Visualize this data
```{r}
ggplot(Full_data, aes(x = FamilySize, fill = FamilySize)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100), position='dodge') +
  geom_text(aes(y = prop.table(..count..) * 100 + 0.5, 
                  label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..) * 100, 2),'%')),
              stat = 'count', 
              position = position_dodge(.9), 
              size = 3) +
    labs(x = 'FamilySize', y = 'percent', fill = 'FamilySize', title ='FamilySize')
```


```{r}

wine_cor <- cor(wine)
#install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
corrplot(wine_cor, method = "number")
```
